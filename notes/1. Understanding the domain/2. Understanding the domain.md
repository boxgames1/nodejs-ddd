- In DDD, the domain drives the design, not the database. The ubiquitous language doesnt know about how the data is persisted. That is known as the *persistence ignorance*, an important DD principle.
- Letting classes drive the design can be just as dangerous as letting a database drive the design.
- Not impose our own technical ideas on the domain and introduce terms/classes/entities that doesn't exist in the real life. Ask the domain expert what a Base Class is.
- To capture domain requirements we can use UML diagrams or a simple text-based language.
  - For workflows we'll document the inputs and outputs and then just use some simple pseudo-code for business logic
  - For data structures we'll use *AND* to mean that both parts are required, and *OR* to mean that either part is required
- It's important to capture design details from the point of view of the domain expert. For example if we need to know how much freedom/flexibility we need to let to something that can change in the future.
