- `param1 -> param2 -> returnedValue` or `int16 -> bool` are examples of function signatures
- Differences
  - Value: member of a type. They are immutables. Functions can be values.
  - Object: encapsulation of a data structure and its assoaciated behavior. It has state, so it's mutable. 
  - In FP, where objects doesn't exist, use "value" instead of "variable" or "object".
- Type composition
  - AND (product types): Set of some types
  - OR (sum types or tagged unions or choice types): Any of some types
- Algebraic type system: every compound type is composed by smaller types. Excellent tool for domain modelling.
- Use simple types as wrappers to give primitives meaningful names
- Put all domain types together in a same folder.
