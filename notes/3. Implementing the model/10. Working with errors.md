- To combine two types in a flow with different errors, we need to adapt errors first using an OR error type.
- If we have to adapt a function that throws an error and need to return something, we can wrap it catching the errors relevant to the domain, returning the exception within the response
- To adapt dead-end functions we need to convert into "pass through" functions: 

```js
    type DeadEndInput = Any
    type DeadEnd = (input:DeadEndInput) => {}
    type adaptedDeadEnd = (input:DeadEndInput) => (input:DeadEndInput)
    const adaptedDeadEnd = (f: DeadEnd, input:DeadEndInput) => {
        f(input)
        return input;
    }
```

- Using this way we adapt a dead-end turning into a one-track function.
- Monads: A monad is a way of composing functions that require context in addition to the return value, such as computation, branching, or I/O. Monads type lift, flatten and map so that the types line up for lifting functions `a => M(b)`, making them composable. It's a mapping from some type `a` to some type `b` along with some computational context, hidden in the implementation details of lift, flatten, and map....
