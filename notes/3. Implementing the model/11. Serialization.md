- Workflows are functions that receive inputs (commands) and return ouputs (events). They come or go to some infrastructure.
- The infra doesnt have any understanding about our particular domain, so we must convert types in our domain model to something that the infra understands (JSON, XML, etc..)
- To serialize domain types easier, use DTO's and serialize the DTO instead of the domain type
- Any validation should be done when converting DTO to domain type, inside the BC.
- Deserialization process is added at the beginning of the workflow and serialization at the end.
- Commands and events are contracts with other BC's, a loose contract to avoid coupling between BC's.
- In JS `JSON` object methods are safe, but in case you need to convert from or to XML (or another format), use a safe and tested 3rd party utility.
- You may want to use a serialization library to avoid tedious work.

### Serialization example

```js
module Domain {
  export type Person = {
    fullName: string;
    birthDate: Date;
  };
}

module DTO {
  export type Person = {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    birthDate: Date;
    fromDomain: (person: Domain.Person) => DTO.Person;
    toDomain: (dto: DTO.Person) => Domain.Person;
  };
}
```

So any DTO type must implement those two functions that allow serializing and de-serializing.
This is a simple example, but it should handle errors.
