- General guidelines
  - Push persistence to the edges
  - Separate commands (updates) from queries (reads)
  - BC's must own their own data store
- Separate workflows into two parts
  - Domain-centric part that contains business logic. Pure functions
  - An "edge" part that contains the I/O-related code
- The domain-centric functions should be easily unit testables while whole workflow may be rely to integration tests
- Injecting dependencies as params also help to improve testability
- If we need to make a decision based on a query we must keep domain parts pure, doing a sandwich with I/O in the edges
- If the workflow falls into a long-running one you can break into smaller pieces.
- Repository pattern is no longer needed when using pure functions and keeping I/O in the edges.

### Command-Query Separation (CQS) 

- With CQS every action receives input and data connection:
  - Reads return data
  - Mutations return nothing
- CQS states that reads should not be mixed with mutations
  - Functions that retrieve data should NOT change the state
  - Functions that have side effects should NOT return data


### Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
