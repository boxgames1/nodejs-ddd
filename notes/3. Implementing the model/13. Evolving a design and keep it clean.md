- DDD is not static, once-only process. It's meant to be continuous collaboration between developers, domain experts and other stakeholders.
- If the requirements change, we have to reevaluate the domain model first, before changing the implementation
- 4 kinds of changes:
  - Add new step in the workflow
  - Changing the input of the workflow
  - Changing the definition of a key domain type and seeing how that ripples through the system
  - Transforming the workflow as a whole to conform with business rules
- Use active patterns to simplify business logic
- When adding a new step, rather than modifying stable code, add a new piece to the workflow, getting the best from the composition.
- Using functions as paremeters and as output is one the most powerful techniques of the FP.
- Keeping the types separate during the domain modelling is a good idea
- If a system evolves enough to get a whole team working on it with different jargon, etc.. It might mean that the piece of system needs to be decoupled in its own BC.
- When modifying or adding constraints, use adapters.
- Function composition allow us to insert new pieces in the workflow without modifying existing and working parts
