- Functional programming is programming as if functions really mattered
- In FP, functions are used everywhere, for everything
- Functions that input or output other functions or take functions as parameters are called *High-order functions*
- When currying, the approach of "baking in" parameters is called *partial application*:
    ```js
        function partial(fn: Function, ...restArgs: Array<any>) {
        return function() {
            const fnArgs = [...restArgs, ...Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)];
            fn.apply(null, fnArgs);
        };
        }
        const Logger = {
        log(level: string, dateFormat: string, msg: string) {
            console.log(level, dateFormat, msg);
        }
        };
        const info = partial(Logger.log, "info", "ISO8601");
        info("Application started"); // info ISO8601 Application started
    ```
- Functions that have every input has a corresponding output are called *Total functions*
- Functions are *composable* if the output of the first is the same type of the second function input
- When piping or combining functions, the input of the first function and the output of the last are the input and output of the *pipeline*
- If input/output doesn't fit (e.g.: `int -> Option<int>`), a common approach is to convert both sides to be the same type, the *lowest common multiple* of each side, as it were.
